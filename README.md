# Emotion Intensity Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the intensity of five emotions—anger, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise—from textual input using a BERT-based model. By using multi-label regression, the model outputs continuous intensity values for each emotion, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of emotional content.

## Features

- Predicts emotion intensity as continuous values between 0 and 1.
- Fine-tuned BERT model for multi-label regression.
- Supports nuanced emotion analysis beyond traditional classification.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Usage

Once the model is trained, input textual data can be processed to predict the intensity of emotions. The system is capable of analyzing any text and returning intensity values for the five supported emotions.
